# JWToken_API

This is a personal project in which I create an API that validates and logs users through JWT and allows access to other controllers, in this case only a list of products.

The passwords of the users are stored employing hash tables, in which instead of the password the hash and its corresponding salt are stored.

The API is developed using C#.Net. The database used was generated in SQL Server with the migration(s).
